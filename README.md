# Custom rc Scripts

A collection of custom rc scripts to improve personal optimization and speed on my Fedora 43 KDE Wayland Linux machine.

## Quick Installation

To copy all files to your home directory:

```bash
chmod +x quick_install.sh && ./quick_install.sh
```
-------------------------------------------------
Note: These scripts were devoloped on Fedora 43 KDE Plasma Wayland. Compatibility on other systems cannot be guaranteed.
