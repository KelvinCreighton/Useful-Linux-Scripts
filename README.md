# Custom rc Scripts

Custom rc scripts to improve personal optimization and speed on my Fedora 40/41 KDE device.

Run commands:
  chmod +x quick_install.sh
  ./quick_install.sh
to quickly copy these files to the home directory

-------------------------------------------------
Note: These scripts were devoloped on Fedora 40 and 41 KDE Plasma with Wayland. Compatibility on other systems cannot be guaranteed.
